An oBTC price widget, simply paste this into your favorite widget app

Example: Download widgery from: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urysoft.widgery

and after that open the app and set these settings: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75716744/154339889-9b64d2e1-6a87-4b7d-9297-cfc8644adaa2.png)
Then go back to your home screen and hold on the backrond, touch widgets, then find Widgery, drag and drop that to your home screen, I'd advise you to change the size, this seems to be the sweet spot: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75716744/154340163-733d1ebd-f02e-4a42-a19e-2a5f9beb1990.png)
